# String_symmetry_checker
Checks if a word or sentence is spelled the same way both reading it forward and reading it backward
It ignores punctuation, case, and spacing.

For example, with strings like:

"madam"
"_madam"
"racecar"
"not a symmetry"
"civic"
"deified"
"0_0 (; [-] ;) 0-0"

the function will return true or false
